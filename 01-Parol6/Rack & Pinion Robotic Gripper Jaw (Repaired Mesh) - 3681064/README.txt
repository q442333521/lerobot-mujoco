Summary:
Modification: Repairing the mesh of two of the modelsOriginal Project: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2661755Servo Controlled Robotic Gripper using rack &amp; pinion drive for parallel jaw movementhttps://youtu.be/Qfd0ikdnAsgThis is a robotic gripper/jaw that uses a low cost Tower Pro MG996R servo.As opposed to some grippers that use a lever action, this directly drives both jaws with a rack and pinion action.It therefore has slightly more grip that traditional lever grippers and the jaw movement is totally parallel.It could be easily modified to fit on to a robotic arm.It requires:Servo Motor (1 pcs): https://www.banggood.com/custlink/GG3vPi6OIBScrews and nuts: https://www.banggood.com/custlink/G3mvFi0OaC· M3x16mm Screws (4 pcs)· M3x10mm Screws (4 pcs)· M3 nuts (8 pcs)Options to control the servo:Servo Controller: https://www.banggood.com/custlink/GKK3HZeOIWArduino: https://www.banggood.com/custlink/3mDGHS0oL9
